# OpenSwimPractice
Reviving Swim.gg with Dragonfly
# Open Sourced (for now)
I did of course leave out all the assets such as world files and entity models, as my artists would not appreciate their work being leaked.
<br>
I don't care about code in that way though, I believe everything should be open sourced to an extent in certain scenarios. 
<br>
So what not a better time to open source a project while I learrn Go and Dragonfly!
<br>
This will probably be closed sourced around the time I start implementing secrets such as an anticheat and database solution
# Current Issues
I don't know Go conventions that well, so there is a lot of cursed project structuring and naming
<br>
Insane boilerplate just for a player event handler, all though it did make things more syntactically sweet
<br>
No multi protocol yet, Flonja will probably work on that again when he gets the chance
<br>
Very incomplete! No hosting or anything fun set up yet, just pure code I've only tested on my own machine.
<br>
I am in the major early technical framework design portion of development still
