# OpenSwimPractice
Reviving Swim.gg with Dragonfly
# Open Sourced (for now)
Assets such as world files and models will not be in this repo, as my artists would not appreciate their work being leaked.
<br>
I don't care about code in that way though, I believe everything should be open sourced to an extent. 
<br>
So what not a better time to open source a project while I learrn Go and Dragonfly!
# Info
Flonja is working on an open sourced multi version dragonfly library for us [here](https://github.com/Flonja/multiversion)
<br>
DidntPot, Flonja, Zodia, and all the bedrock gophers have been helping me quite a lot. 
<br>
Thank you to all of them for sharing knowledge and showing me the ropes.
<br>
I will only close source the server if people start blatantly skidding or try to do malicious things with this code (sell it as their own core, etc)
# Current Issues
I don't know Go conventions that well, so there is a lot of cursed project structuring and naming.
<br>
Far from complete game play wise, but the systems are coming together nicely.
